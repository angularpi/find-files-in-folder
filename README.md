# find-files-in-folder
<strong>Objective:</strong> Given a folder that contains 1,000 files, find and copy the files contained in a list (csv file) to a new folder.

<strong>Approach:</strong> This is a real life example. I had a folder with 1,000~ files. After doing some analysis, I needed to extract 100~ and copy them to a new folder.

I did not want to go one by one, so I decided to give it a try using PowerShell (the fancy Windows console).

<strong>Results:</strong> It took me 20 minutes to plan and write the code, the scrip runs in a blink, saving hours of repetitive work.
